Project introduction

    PI store, we are committed to getting through PI offline consumption scenarios, and more than 600 merchants have settled in! You can visit the website https://pi-store.app We understand that we hope to get through the offline physical consumption scenario of pi and promote the circulation of pi in the real economy, so as to promote the real implementation of dispatch payment. Most of our businesses come from the settlement of high consensus dispatch friends with physical stores. Users can get the nearest service merchants to purchase goods and services according to the location. After purchasing, a QR code will be generated, and then the QR code will be displayed according to the navigation to the address of the merchants, The merchant can complete the order after scanning the code!

The right to put goods on and off the shelves and pricing are completely determined by the merchants. We have provided a complete set of supporting programs, and we have developed a total of three systems. The user end is used to find businesses and place orders, the merchant end is used for businesses to view revenue, withdraw cash and write off user Ding Dandan, and the management end is used for platform management.

Project characteristics

    The difference between us and other projects is that we are a multi-benefit project:

      1. In order to encourage more merchants to join, we have joined the promoter system. As long as the merchants are invited to settle in, the promoter can get  commission for all user orders for goods purchased by this merchant in the future.

      2. In order to encourage more users to use our products, we have joined the promotion system. As long as users bind to their superiors, the superior users can also get corresponding commissions for their consumption orders.

      3. In order to activate user activity, we have set up a sign-in module. The points given by sign-in can be deducted from the corresponding payment amount for the purchase of goods. In the future, we will add more interactive games for the convenience of users.

Project progress

    Current project progress

    All development has been completed, and the final debugging stage is in progress!

System architecture

    It uses the SpringCloud microservice architecture, the front-end uses Vue.js development, the database uses MySQL+MongoDB+Redis, and the deployment environment uses Kubernetes+docker deployment.

    At present, the servers are deployed in four clusters of ECS, and will be dynamically expanded according to the actual usage.
